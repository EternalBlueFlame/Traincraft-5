/**
 * Batteries the heart of the Charge Network.
 *
 * Consumers and 'wires' don't need batteries, but generators and battery blocks do.
 *
 * You don't to have a Tile Entity to provide a battery for the network,
 * serialization and ticking is handled by the network itself.
 *
 * Generators should add their power output directly to its battery object.
 *
 * You shouldn't hold onto battery objects for longer than you need them.
 * The API makes no guarantee that the battery object assigned to a specific coordinate
 * will always be the same object.
 *
 * Such that sometimes:
 * {@code
 * IBatteryBlock bat1 = Charge.distribution.network(world).access(pos).getBattery();
 * IBatteryBlock bat2 = Charge.distribution.network(world).access(pos).getBattery();
 * bat1 != bat2
 * }
