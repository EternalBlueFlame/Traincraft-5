##What is Traincraft?
Traincraft is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod built using [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge).

Traincraft alters the looks of and adds new functionality to various aspects of the game. It adds over 80 trains, wagons, and other vehicles as well as a new railway system with curved tracks and slopes.<br/>Traincraft was originally created by **Spitfire4466**, then jointly developed with **Mrbrutal**, and subsequently maintained by **Mrbrutal**. *This fork is maintained by several devs, including **EternalBlueFLame**.* 
Traincraft has had well over **1,000,000 downloads** and has been in development since Minecraft 1.2.5.

##Ooh, what's this fork?
This specific fork is maintained by **EternalBlueFlame** and is intended to port and cleanup Traincraft from 1.6.4 to 1.7.10. The overarching purpose of this fork is to contribute to the overall Traincraft project by bringing it to newer Minecraft versions.<br/>This branch is an unofficial derivative until otherwise stated by **Mrbrutal** and or **Spitfire4466**.

**Mrbrutal** and **Spitfire4466** still maintain full rights and project lead in this fork.<br/><br/> **This fork has a number of issues, defined in the above mentioned Trello, which our current development group is unable to fix, development is ceased until someone can fix these issues.**

##Why did **Mrbrutal** post the Source Code?
> As of late, **Spitfire4466** and **Mrbrutal** have had little time to work on Traincraft. Open-sourcing the mod was the only viable option that would ensure its continuation. Message from **Mrbrutal**: I have never open-sourced a project on this level or size, and am a bit hesitant to do so. However, in the hopes that we can make Traincraft great again (no this is not a Trump reference) and that I can still be a part of this, I have open-sourced both versions of Traincraft  here on Github. Anyone that is willing to contribute can contribute as long as they have signed the CLA (scroll down).

Setting up the project was made easy with the setup.bat file.<br/>
